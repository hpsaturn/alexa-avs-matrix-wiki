## About the project

This project provides a step-by-step walkthrough to help you build a **hands-free** [Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/avs) (AVS) prototype in 60 minutes, using wake word engines from [Sensory](https://github.com/Sensory/alexa-rpi) or [KITT.AI](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy). Now, in addition to pushing a button to "start listening", you can now also just say the wake word "Alexa", much like the Amazon Echo. You can find step-by-step instructions to set it up on [Raspberry Pi](Raspberry-Pi), [Mac](Mac), [Linux](Linux) or [Windows](Windows).

## What is AVS?

[Alexa Voice Service](https://developer.amazon.com/avs) (AVS)  is Amazonâ€™s intelligent voice recognition and natural language understanding service that allows you as a developer to voice-enable any connected device that has a microphone and speaker.

## What's new?

**December 8, 2016:**

The AVS java sample app for Raspberry Pi has been updated for two changes:  

1.	The sample app now supports GPIO triggers for use with the Conexant 2-Mic Development Kit for Amazon AVS. [Click here](Conexant2Mic-Raspberry-Pi) for step-by-step instructions.  
2.	The sample app is now officially certified for media and music services.  

**October 6, 2016:**

How is this different from the [last Amazon Alexa Pi project](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-avs-raspberry-pi/tree/79b7df7aaa4c5304446f59c0bd3ee2589b245115)? That's easy, two wake word engines are included with this project - [TrulyHandsFree](https://github.com/Sensory/alexa-rpi) from [Sensory](http://www.sensory.com/) and [Snowboy](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy) from  [KITT.AI](http://kitt.ai). When you're finished, you'll have a working voice-enabled AVS prototype.

## Important considerations

* The earcons associated with the sample project are for prototyping purposes only. For implementation and design guidance for commercial products, please see [Designing for AVS
Use](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/content/designing-for-the-alexa-voice-service) and [AVS UX Guidelines](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/content/alexa-voice-service-ux-design-guidelines).

* Alexa Voice Service [Terms & Agreements](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-voice-service/support/terms-and-agreements)

* **Usage of Sensory & KITT.AI wake word engines**: The wake word engines included with this project (Sensory and KITT.AI) are intended to be used for **prototyping purposes only**. If you are building a commercial product with either solution, please use the contact information below to enquire about commercial licensing -
  * [Contact Sensory](http://www.sensory.com/support/contact/us-sales/) for information on TrulyHandsFree  licensing.
  * [Contact KITT.AI](mailto:snowboy@kitt.ai) for information on SnowBoy licensing.

* **IMPORTANT** The Sensory wake word engine included with this project is time-limited: code linked against it will stop working when the library expires. The library included in this repository will, at all times, have an expiration date that is at least **120 days** in the future. See Sensory's [GitHub](https://github.com/Sensory/alexa-rpi#license) page for more information on how to renew the license for non-commercial use.
