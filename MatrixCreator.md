This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up AVS on a **Raspberry Pi**. It demonstrates how to access and test AVS using our Java sample app (running on a Raspberry Pi), a Node.js server, and a third-party wake word engine. You will use the Node.js server to obtain a Login with Amazon (LWA) authorization code by visiting a website using your Raspberry Pi's web browser.

For instructions on how to set it up on [Mac](Mac), [Linux](Linux) or [Windows](Windows), please see our [wiki]().
